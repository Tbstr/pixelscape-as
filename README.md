=============

My library for the development of ActionScript3 projects.

It's poorly documented but I will try to add example projects for a better understanding of the single parts.

The library depends on:
- greensock framework for animation: http://www.greensock.com/
- pyro for video playback: https://code.google.com/p/pyro-player/
